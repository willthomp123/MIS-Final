                <p>My name is William Thompson, and I’m a college student from Seattle studying international business - a perfect fit for someone who grew up bouncing between Spain, London, and the Pacific Northwest. Moving around taught me to adapt quickly, whether switching school systems or learning to cheer for both Chelsea and the Seahawks. These days, I’m usually in Seattle with my two dogs, Emmy and Leo, but I still crave adventures, whether traveling abroad or exploring the mountains in my backyard.

                <p>I live for the thrill of competition, both as a former student-athlete and a lifelong sports fan (Mariners, Kraken, and pickup tennis matches included). When I’m not debating football tactics or skiing down Crystal Mountain, you’ll find me planning my next trip. But no matter where I go, I recharge by hiking with my dogs or going fishing..</p>
